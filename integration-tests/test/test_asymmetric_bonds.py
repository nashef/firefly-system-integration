"""
Asymmetric Bond Weight Integration Tests

Verifies that consensus behaves correctly with non-equal validator stakes.
These tests use a custom shard with asymmetric bond weights (60/20/15) and
heartbeat enabled, exercising the production multi-parent merge path with
unequal weights.

Bond configuration:
    validator1  60   (63.2% of total)
    validator2  20   (21.1% of total)
    validator3  15   (15.8% of total)
    Total:      95

With FTT=0.5, a block needs FT > 0.5 to finalize. This is achievable when
the majority stake (V1=60 alone is 63.2%, exceeding 50%) builds on a block.
Finalization should occur faster than with equal weights and FTT=0.99.
