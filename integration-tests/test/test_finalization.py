Finalization Integration Tests

Tests that verify block finalization advances correctly in a multi-validator
shard with heartbeat-driven block creation.

Uses the session-scoped shard fixture (boot + 3 validators + readonly)
with fault-tolerance-threshold = 0.99 and equal bond weights (1000 each).
With 3 validators at equal weight, a block's fault tolerance reaches 1.0
when all validators have built on it, exceeding the 0.99 threshold. This
should happen within a few heartbeat rounds (~15-30s).
