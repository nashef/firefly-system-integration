"""
Genesis Ceremony Integration Test

Validates that the shard's genesis ceremony completed successfully.
The ceremony is performed implicitly by docker-compose startup:
  - bootstrap-ceremony.conf has required-signatures=2, ceremony-master-mode=true
  - Validators have genesis-validator-mode=true
  - The shard fixture waits for all nodes to reach Running state

This test verifies the ceremony results post-startup rather than
orchestrating the ceremony in real-time.
