"""
Deployment Integration Tests

Tests for deploy error handling: insufficient phlo, phlo exhaustion.
Uses the session-scoped shard fixture with heartbeat-driven block creation.

Previously, deploying with insufficient phlo triggered NeglectedInvalidBlock
crashes. This was resolved by fixing non-deterministic merge ordering in
the consensus layer (EventLogIndex, DeployChainIndex, ConflictSetMerger)
and adding transient-error recovery in the Proposer.
