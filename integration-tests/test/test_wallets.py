"""Wallet / REV transfer integration tests.

Tests run against the compose-managed shard. Wallet balances come from
the shared genesis/wallets.txt. All validator keys have funded wallets:

    VALIDATOR1 (111127RX...): 50,000,000,000,000,000 REV
    VALIDATOR2 (111129p3...): 50,000,000,000,000,000 REV
    VALIDATOR3 (1111LAd2...): 500,000,000,000,000,000 REV

Deploys and proposes go through validator1.
