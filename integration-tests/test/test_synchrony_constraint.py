Synchrony Constraint Integration Test

Verifies that the per-validator synchrony constraint threshold is enforced
correctly. Each validator is configured with a different threshold, and the
test orchestrates block creation to confirm that:

1. Every validator can propose its first block after genesis (exempt from
   the constraint).
2. A validator whose threshold is not met is rejected when trying to propose
   a second time.
3. After sufficient blocks from other validators arrive (meeting the
   threshold), the validator can propose again.

Uses a custom shard with 3 validators, heartbeat disabled, and per-node
synchrony-constraint-threshold overrides.

Bond configuration:
    validator1  100  threshold=0.67
    validator2  102  threshold=0.33
    validator3   98  threshold=0.99

Bootstrap is not bonded (ceremony master only) and has zero weight in the
synchrony calculation.

Synchrony math (all weights among active/bonded validators only):
    V1 (100): other-stake = 102+98 = 200. Need >= 0.67*200 = 134. V2 alone (102) is not enough; need V2+V3.
    V2 (102): other-stake = 100+98 = 198. Need >= 0.33*198 = 65.3. V1 alone (100) suffices.
    V3 (98):  other-stake = 100+102 = 202. Need >= 0.99*202 = 199.98. Need both V1 and V2.
