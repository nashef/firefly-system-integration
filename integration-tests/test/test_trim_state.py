Trim State Integration Test

Verifies that a new node joining an existing network correctly syncs from
the Last Finalized State (LFS / "trimmed state") rather than replaying
the entire chain from genesis.

Uses a custom shard with:
- 1 genesis validator (V1) -- single validator so every block is immediately
  finalized (no need to coordinate with other validators)
- FTT = -1 (all blocks with FT > -1 are finalized, i.e. immediate finalization)
- heartbeat disabled (manual block orchestration for deterministic chain)
- synchrony-constraint-threshold = 0 (no constraint on single validator)

The test:
1. Creates multiple finalized blocks on V1 with diverse contract deploys
2. Adds a joiner node mid-test via add_peer_to_shard
3. Verifies the joiner sees the latest block (synced from LFS)
4. Continues creating blocks on V1 and verifies the joiner keeps up
5. Has the joiner propose its own blocks and verifies V1 sees them

This confirms the trim/LFS mechanism works: the joiner doesn't need to
replay all historical blocks, just catch up from the last finalized state.
