"""
Heartbeat Integration Tests

Tests for the heartbeat proposer functionality that automatically creates blocks
to maintain blockchain liveness when the Last Finalized Block (LFB) becomes stale.

Both Rust (f1r3node-rust-3) and Scala (f1r3node-scala) share the same heartbeat
proposer implementation (node/src/rust/instances/heartbeat_proposer.rs) with
identical log messages:
  - "Heartbeat: Starting with random initial delay of Xs ..."
  - "Heartbeat: Successfully created block"
  - "Heartbeat: Proposing block - reason: ..."
  - "CONFIGURATION ERROR: Heartbeat incompatible with max-number-of-parents=1"

Concurrent propose handling (both repos):
  - Uses Semaphore(1) non-blocking lock in ProposerInstance
  - If lock is held, returns "Failure: another propose is in progress" immediately
  - Heartbeat logs: "Heartbeat: Propose already in progress, will retry next check"

Standalone tests start a fresh node per test via docker-compose.
Shard tests use the session-scoped shard fixture (shared across tests).
