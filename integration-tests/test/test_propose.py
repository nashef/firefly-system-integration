Propose / Deploy Integration Tests

Tests for deploy validation (invalid contracts, phlo price enforcement) and
cross-validator deploy-to-block lookup in a multi-validator shard.

Standalone tests use a fresh node via docker-compose (start_standalone_node).
Shard tests use the session-scoped shard fixture (shared across the suite).
